                    I created this 3D model using hard surface modeling techniques in Blender 4.3. The final model consists of approximately 249,300 triangles.
                    The entire development process, including ideation and design iteration, took roughly 14 hours. Since the model is intended for cinematic and non-real-time use,
                    I created the booster rocket visual effects directly within Blender using its built-in VFX tools. If this had been a game-ready asset,
                    I would have opted to develop the visual effects using Unity’s Shuriken particle system for better performance optimization in real-time environments.

                        I also created a render of the mech in flight, depicted soaring through the sky.
                        The environment features a custom sky shader, which I projected onto a dome within Blender 4.3 to provide a stylized atmospheric backdrop.
                        While the majority of the image was developed entirely in Blender, I performed additional post-processing using external image editing software to enhance the final composition.
                        To further refine the visual style and emphasize the model’s silhouette and form, I utilized Blender’s Freestyle line art tool, which added a clean illustrative touch to the renders
